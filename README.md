## About Me

I'm a junior Computer Science student with a concentration in Cybersecurity and a minor in Artificial Intelligence. I enjoy building tools that detect threats, automate security tasks, and make Linux systems more resilient.  

Currently, I’m working on hands-on projects like SSH log analysis (LogSleuth), real-time IP blocking (BlockSleuth) in my home lab, and building my own PC. I love learning by doing, whether it’s defensive scripting, offensive security research, or experimenting in virtual machines.  

Outside of tech, I'm learning Twi and always looking for ways to combine language, logic, and creativity in everything I do!
